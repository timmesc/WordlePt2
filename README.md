# Project 2 - Wordle

Submitted by: Charles Times

Wordle is an app that randomly selects a word from 3 categories, those being animals, countries, and normal. There are custom lengths to the words, a user may chose between 4,5,and 6 character words. there is an aditional feature that makes the game much more rigorous. This feature is called alien mode, in which a user can turn it on and for each time they submit the wrong guess the word goal is reset to a new word. 

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had some trouble implementing the reset button. I ended up not getting it as I am choosing to study for calc 2 midterm :( However, I am going to come back and try it over my spring break.
